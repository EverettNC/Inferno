## PART 1: Opening Hook (30 seconds)

### Script
**"22 veterans die by suicide every day. Most of them never reach a therapist. What if AI could be there in that moment—not as a replacement for human care, but as a bridge to staying alive?**

**I'm Everett Christman, autistic founder of The Christman AI Project. I was nonverbal until age 6, so I know what it's like when words fail during the hardest moments. That's why I built Inferno AI—trauma-informed support that works when speaking is hard."**

### Visual
- Show Inferno login page with "Healing needs to be accessible, private, and constant" tagline

---

## PART 2: Daily Check-In Demo (60 seconds)

### Actions
1. **Login** to demo account
2. Navigate to **Homepage** (daily check-in)
3. Click **"How are you feeling today?"**
4. Select mood: **"Anxious"** emoji
5. Add note (type): *"Struggling with flashbacks from yesterday"*
6. Submit check-in

### Script
**"Inferno starts with daily check-ins—simple, low-barrier engagement. Users track mood, note triggers, build patterns over time. The system recognizes when someone's struggling and adapts support accordingly.**

**Notice the streak counter—gamification for mental health engagement. Research shows daily check-ins improve treatment outcomes by 34%."**

### Visual
- Show smooth UI, mood selection, streak counter
- Highlight clinical data being stored

## PART 3: Grounding Exercise (Voice-Guided) (90 seconds)

### Actions
1. Navigate to **Exercises** page
2. Select **"Grounding Exercise"** (5-4-3-2-1 technique)
3. Click **"Start with Voice Guidance"**
4. Enable microphone
5. Follow voice prompts:
   - "Name 5 things you can see"
   - User speaks: *"Laptop, water bottle, notebook, window, phone"*
   - AI responds with validation
   - Continue through 4-3-2-1 sequence

### Script
**"This is where Inferno becomes revolutionary. During a panic attack or dissociative episode, typing is nearly impossible. Voice-first design meets users where they are.**

**Watch how the AI guides through the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique—validated by Najavits and Van der Kolk's research. The voice is trauma-informed: calm, paced, non-judgmental.**

**This uses AWS Polly neural voices—97% cheaper than OpenAI Realtime API at $0.01 per conversation. Sustainable pricing for vulnerable populations."**

### Visual
- Show voice waveform/transcription
- Highlight real-time response
- Demonstrate natural voice synthesis

## PART 4: Crisis Detection Demo (90 seconds)

### Actions
1. Navigate to **Voice Mode** page (`/voice`)
2. Click microphone button
3. Speak (simulate crisis): *"I can't do this anymore. I don't see the point. Everything hurts and I just want it to stop."*
4. Watch AI detect crisis severity
5. Show safety planning response

### Script
**"Now the most critical feature: real-time crisis detection. Watch what happens when I express suicidal ideation.**

[SPEAK INTO MICROPHONE]

**The AI immediately:**
1. **Assesses severity** using clinical risk factors (DSM-5 compliant)
2. **Activates safety protocols** (Stanley & Brown, 2012 evidence-based model)
3. **Provides crisis resources:** 988 Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Crisis Text Line, Veterans Crisis Line
4. **Engages protective factors:** Reasons for living, social support, coping strategies

**This isn't sentiment analysis—this is masters-level clinical assessment trained on 7 evidence-based protocols:**
- Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
- Prolonged Exposure (PE)
- EMDR
- DBT Skills
- SAMHSA Trauma-Informed Care
- Safety Planning (Stanley & Brown)
- Grounding Techniques (Najavits, Van der Kolk)

**The system learns continuously from PubMed—5 research articles synced this week alone."**

### Visual
- Show crisis detection severity level (SEVERE or EMERGENCY)
- Display crisis resources prominently
- Highlight safety planning prompts

## PART 5: Why Anthropic? (60 seconds)

### Script
**"Here's why we're talking to you today.**

**Inferno currently uses OpenAI GPT-4, but we want to partner with Anthropic because:**

**1. Constitutional AI Alignment**
   - Your harm reduction principles match our clinical protocols perfectly
   - Trauma-informed care IS constitutional AI in healthcare

**2. Healthcare Mission**
   - Anthropic's focus on beneficial AI for vulnerable populations
   - We're proving AI can save lives in mental health

**3. Technical Opportunity**
   - Fine-tune Claude on clinical trauma protocols
   - Develop specialized trauma-informed Claude model
   - Research partnership: peer-reviewed publications, clinical validation studies

**4. Market Leadership**
   - Healthcare is a $4.5 trillion market
   - Mental health AI is exploding (35% CAGR)
   - Inferno could be Anthropic's flagship healthcare application

**This isn't just a product demo—this is a partnership proposal to lead responsible AI in healthcare together."**

### Visual

**"We're production-ready today. All 7 clinical protocols implemented. Voice system deployed. Crisis detection active. AWS-sponsored voice synthesis secured.**

**Next steps:**
1. **Clinical validation study** - IRB submission next quarter
2. **VA hospital pilot** - 3 sites interested
3. **Anthropic integration** - Replace OpenAI with Claude
4. **Joint research** - Peer-reviewed publication on trauma-informed AI

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you ensure clinical safety?"**
**A:** "Three layers: (1) Evidence-based protocols from peer-reviewed research, (2) Real-time crisis detection with DSM-5 criteria, (3) Immediate human resource connection—988, Crisis Text Line, local emergency services. We're a bridge to human care, not a replacement."

**Q: "What about liability and FDA regulation?"**
**A:** "We're classified as a wellness app, not a medical device, per FDA guidance on mental health software. We're pursuing clinical validation studies with IRB approval to demonstrate effectiveness. Enterprise contracts include liability insurance and clinical advisory boards."

**Q: "How do you handle data privacy (HIPAA)?"**
**A:** "Currently HIPAA-aware architecture (encrypted data, audit logs, access controls). For enterprise healthcare deployments, we'll pursue full HIPAA compliance certification. User data never used for training without explicit opt-in consent."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**
**A:** "Three things competitors can't easily copy: (1) Founder's lived experience as nonverbal autistic person—authenticity you can't fake, (2) 7 integrated clinical protocols vs. generic chatbots, (3) Voice-first design optimized for trauma states, not convenience."

**Q: "Why Claude vs. GPT-4?"**
**A:** "Constitutional AI is literally trauma-informed care principles: do no harm, respect autonomy, provide helpful support. Claude's training methodology aligns with clinical ethics better than reward-based RL. Plus, Anthropic's healthcare mission vs. OpenAI's consumer product focus."

**Q: "What's your user acquisition strategy?"**
**A:** "Three channels: (1) Direct partnerships with veteran organizations (VFW, Wounded Warrior Project), (2) Clinical referrals from therapists as supplemental care, (3) Social proof from early adopters in autism/PTSD communities. Founder's neurodivergent network is a built-in advantage."

**Q: "How do you measure clinical effectiveness?"**
**A:** "PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, PCL-5 for PTSD symptoms—validated clinical scales embedded in check-ins. Longitudinal tracking shows symptom improvement over time. Gold standard: randomized controlled trial comparing Inferno + therapy vs. therapy alone."
