## 12. Critical Concerns

### ⚠️ **Clinical Validation Not Complete**
- Claims about crisis interventions (156+ lives saved) are unverified
- No peer-reviewed published research
- IRB approval pending
- Not FDA-approved medical device

### ⚠️ **Marketing vs Reality**
- README uses enthusiastic language that may oversell
- Some features appear aspirational vs implemented
  - "Computer vision facial expression analysis" not found in code
  - "3D visual effects" not verified in frontend
- Community member counts may be illustrative

### ⚠️ **Liability Concerns**
- AI providing crisis intervention creates legal exposure
- Not positioned as medical device (avoids FDA but limits credibility)
- No professional oversight mentioned
- Actual crisis situations could exceed AI capabilities

### ⚠️ **HIPAA Gap**
- "HIPAA-aware" ≠ "HIPAA-certified"
- Enterprise healthcare deployment blocked until certified
- Health data encryption not fully verified
