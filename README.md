> *"Healing needs to be accessible, private, and constant."*

**Inferno AI** is a clinical-grade, trauma-informed AI platform built to provide 24/7 PTSD and anxiety support for those who need it most.

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

**22 veterans die by suicide every day.** Millions more struggle with PTSD, anxiety, and trauma without access to consistent, affordable mental health care. Traditional therapy requires:
- Weeks of waiting for appointments
- $100-300 per session costs
- Geographic proximity to qualified therapists
- Ability to communicate verbally during crisis moments

**Inferno changes this.** We provide immediate, voice-guided, clinically-validated support that's always available when someone needs it most.

## üåü Why This Matters

### The Founder's Story
Everett Christman was nonverbal until age 6. As an autistic adult, he understands what it's like when:
- Words don't come during a panic attack
- You need help but can't ask for it
- Traditional therapy isn't accessible or affordable
- You're judged for how you communicate

**Inferno exists because no one should struggle alone when technology can help.**

### The Bigger Mission
Inferno is one of 7 specialized AI platforms under The Christman AI Project:
- **AlphaVox** - AAC for nonverbal individuals
- **Inferno** - PTSD/anxiety support (this platform)
- **AlphaWolf** - Dementia care
- **AlphaDen** - Down syndrome adaptive learning
- **OmegaAlpha** - Senior companionship
- **Aegis AI** - Child protection
- **Omega** - Smart prosthetics

**Core principle:** *"How can we help you love yourself more?"*
