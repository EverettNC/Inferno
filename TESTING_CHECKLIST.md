# Inferno AI - Pre-Presentation Testing Checklist
## Comprehensive QA Before Anthropic Demo

---

## Testing Philosophy

**Goal:** Verify every claim made in presentation materials works flawlessly in demo environment.

**Standard:** If it's mentioned in the pitch deck or demo script, it must work 100% reliably.

**Timeline:** Complete all tests 48 hours before presentation (allows time to fix issues).

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] PostgreSQL running (`pg_isready`)
- [ ] All environment variables set in `.env`
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install` completed without errors)
- [ ] Database migrations applied (`npm run db:push` successful)
- [ ] Development server can start (`npm run dev` works)
- [ ] Production build succeeds (`npm run build` no errors)

### Environment Variables Verification
```bash
# Create this script: check_env.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking environment variables..."

if [ -z "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then
  echo "❌ DATABASE_URL not set"
else
  echo "✅ DATABASE_URL set"
fi

if [ -z "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "❌ OPENAI_API_KEY not set"
else
  echo "✅ OPENAI_API_KEY set (starts with ${OPENAI_API_KEY:0:7}...)"
fi

if [ -z "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID not set (optional for AWS Polly)"
else
  echo "✅ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID set"
fi

if [ -z "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY not set (optional for AWS Polly)"
else
  echo "✅ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY set"
fi

if [ -z "$AWS_REGION" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  AWS_REGION not set (optional for AWS Polly)"
