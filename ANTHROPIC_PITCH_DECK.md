# SLIDE 1: The Crisis

## 22 Veterans Die by Suicide Every Day

### The Mental Health Access Gap
- **6-month wait** for first therapy appointment
- **$150-300/session** out-of-pocket costs
- **50% of rural counties** have zero psychiatrists
- **When crisis hits at 2 AM**, no one answers

### The Cost in Lives
- 19.5M Americans with PTSD
- 40M with anxiety disorders
- 1.7M Iraq/Afghanistan veterans suffering
- **Millions struggle alone**

> "What if AI could be there in that momentâ€”not as replacement for human care, but as a bridge to staying alive?"
