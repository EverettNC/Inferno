# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Inferno AI community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Trauma-informed communication** - Being sensitive to others' mental health needs
* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Supporting veterans and military families** with respect and understanding
* **Centering neurodivergent voices** and experiences in accessibility discussions

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Triggering content** without appropriate warnings
* **Dismissing or minimizing** trauma experiences
* **Ableist language** or discrimination against neurodivergent individuals
* **The use of sexualized language** or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
* **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
* **Public or private harassment**
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* **Sharing clinical advice** without proper credentials
* **Violating confidentiality** of community discussions

## Special Considerations

### Mental Health Community Guidelines

* **No clinical diagnosis** or medical advice unless you are a licensed professional
* **Content warnings** for potentially triggering material
* **Respect for ongoing treatment** - never suggest stopping professional care
* **Crisis protocol respect** - do not interfere with emergency interventions
* **Confidentiality** - what's shared in support channels stays private

### Veterans Community Standards

* **Respect for service** regardless of branch, rank, or deployment status
* **No stolen valor** - only claim experiences you actually had
* **Support without judgment** - everyone's service and struggles are valid
* **Family inclusion** - military families deserve respect and support
* **Transition sensitivity** - civilian adjustment challenges are real

### Neurodivergent-Friendly Environment

* **Clear communication** - avoid ambiguous language when possible
* **Sensory considerations** - minimize overwhelming visual/audio elements
* **Executive function support** - provide clear instructions and deadlines
* **Stimming acceptance** - neurodivergent self-regulation is welcome
* **Communication differences** - respect various communication styles

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary Contact:** lumacognify@thechristmanaiproject.com

**Anonymous Reporting:** Available through GitHub Issues with the "Code of Conduct" label

### Response Timeline

* **Immediate response** for crisis situations or safety concerns
* **24-48 hours** for general code of conduct violations
* **Weekly review** of ongoing situations

### Investigation Process

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Clinical and Safety Considerations

### Crisis Intervention Protocol

* **Immediate safety** takes precedence over community guidelines
* **Professional intervention** may be initiated for safety reasons
* **Documentation** of safety incidents follows HIPAA-compliant procedures
* **Follow-up support** provided after crisis resolution

### Mental Health Professional Standards

Licensed mental health professionals in our community are expected to:

* **Maintain professional boundaries** even in informal settings
* **Provide appropriate disclaimers** when sharing clinical knowledge
* **Respect scope of practice** - don't practice outside your license
* **Protect confidentiality** of any professional relationships
