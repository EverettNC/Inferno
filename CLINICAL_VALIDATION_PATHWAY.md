## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Negative Trial Results
**Mitigation:**
- Pilot study first (course-correct before large RCT)
- User feedback loops (iterate features)
- Statistical consultation (ensure adequate power)
- Backup plan: Publish null results (transparency), analyze subgroups that did benefit

### Risk 2: Regulatory Burden
**Mitigation:**
- Start as wellness app (lowest barrier)
- Monitor FDA guidance updates
- Engage regulatory consultants early
- Phased approach (don't need FDA clearance for VA pilot)

### Risk 3: Low Recruitment/Retention
**Mitigation:**
- Partner with organizations with existing patient populations (VA, CMHCs)
- Offer meaningful incentives ($100 gift cards)
- User-centered design (reduce friction)
- Engagement features (streak counters, push notifications)

### Risk 4: Data Security Breach
**Mitigation:**
- HIPAA-compliant infrastructure (AWS, encryption)
- Third-party security audits (annual)
- Incident response plan
- Cyber liability insurance

### Risk 5: Competition
**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage (voice-first PTSD app)
- Clinical protocols as IP (proprietary algorithms)
- Strong clinical evidence (competitors lack RCTs)
- Community trust (neurodivergent-led authenticity)
