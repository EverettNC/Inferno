# Security Audit Report - Inferno AI Platform

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Auditor:** AI Security Assessment  
**Project:** Inferno AI - Trauma-Informed AI Companion  

## Executive Summary

This security audit was performed on the Inferno AI platform, a trauma-informed AI companion application. The audit included dependency scanning, secret detection, static code analysis, and configuration review. **Several critical vulnerabilities were identified and remediated** during the audit process.

### Overall Security Posture
- **Initial State:** CRITICAL - Multiple high-risk vulnerabilities
- **After Remediation:** GOOD - Most critical issues resolved
- **Risk Level:** LOW-MODERATE

## Key Findings Summary

| Category | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Status |
|----------|----------|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Authentication | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Dependencies | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| Secrets | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Configuration | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Input Validation | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | üîÑ In Progress |

## Critical Vulnerabilities Found & Remediated

### 1. Hard-coded Authentication Credentials (CRITICAL - FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Finding:** Default password "inferno2024" was hard-coded in client signup flow  
**Risk:** Any user could access any account  
**Remediation:** 
- Removed hard-coded password
- Added password input field requiring user-defined credentials
- Implemented bcrypt password hashing (salt rounds: 10)
- Updated authentication flow to use secure password comparison

### 2. Missing Security Headers (HIGH - FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Finding:** No security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)  
**Risk:** XSS, CSRF, and abuse vulnerabilities  
**Remediation:**
- Added helmet.js for security headers
- Configured CORS with environment-based origin restrictions
- Implemented rate limiting (60 requests/minute on /api routes)

### 3. Plaintext Password Storage (CRITICAL - FIXED ‚úÖ)
**Finding:** Passwords stored in plaintext in both memory and database storage  
**Risk:** Complete credential exposure in data breach  
**Remediation:**
- Implemented bcrypt hashing for all password storage
- Updated both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage classes
- Authentication now uses secure password comparison

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

### Removed Vulnerable Dependencies ‚úÖ
- `gtts` (critical: form-data vulnerability)
- `build` (critical: js-yaml, uglify-js vulnerabilities) 
- `boto3`, `fastapi`, `python-dotenv`, `uvicorn` (unused)
- `speechrecognizer`, `polly` (unused)

### Remaining Low-Risk Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `esbuild` (moderate): Development-only vulnerability in dev server
- `drizzle-kit` dependencies: Dev-only, requires breaking change to fix

**Recommendation:** Monitor for updates, consider fixing in next major release.

## Secret Detection Results

### Found Secrets (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- Hard-coded password in client code: REMOVED
- Environment variables properly externalized:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` 
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ Use `.env` files for all secrets (already implemented)
2. ‚úÖ Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (verified)
3. üîÑ Consider using a secret management service for production

## High-Risk Endpoints Analysis

### Authentication Endpoints ‚úÖ
- `/api/auth/login` - Now properly secured with bcrypt
- `/api/auth/register` - Server-side password hashing implemented

### AI & Voice Endpoints ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `/api/ai/chat` - No authentication required (by design for demo)
- `/api/realtime-voice` - WebSocket endpoint, no auth validation
- `/api/voice/*` - TTS endpoints, no rate limiting beyond global

**Recommendation:** Consider adding authentication for production deployment.

### Data Endpoints ‚úÖ
- User data endpoints require valid user ID
- No SQL injection vectors found (using Drizzle ORM)

## Configuration Security Review

### Server Configuration ‚úÖ
- **CORS:** Properly configured with environment-based origins
- **Rate Limiting:** 60 req/min on API routes (configurable via env)
- **Headers:** Helmet.js security headers enabled
- **Host Binding:** Environment-aware (localhost dev, 0.0.0.0 prod)

### Missing Configurations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **HTTPS:** Not enforced (requires deployment configuration)
- **Session Management:** No session security (stateless design)
- **CSP:** Basic helmet CSP (could be more restrictive)

## Remediation Summary

### Implemented Fixes ‚úÖ
1. **Password Security:** bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
2. **Security Headers:** helmet.js middleware
3. **CORS Protection:** Environment-based origin restrictions
4. **Rate Limiting:** API endpoint protection
5. **Secret Removal:** Hard-coded credentials eliminated
6. **Dependency Cleanup:** Removed 7 vulnerable unused packages

### Security Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "helmet": "^7.0.0",
  "express-rate-limit": "^6.10.0", 
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3"
}
```

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### High Priority üî¥
1. **HTTPS Enforcement:** Configure TLS termination
2. **Environment Secrets:** Use proper secret management
3. **Database Security:** Configure connection encryption
4. **Monitoring:** Add security event logging

### Medium Priority üü°  
1. **Authentication:** Add user session management
2. **Input Validation:** Stricter API input sanitization
3. **CSP:** More restrictive content security policy
4. **Dependency Updates:** Keep security patches current

### Low Priority üü¢
1. **Audit Logging:** User action audit trail
2. **API Documentation:** Security considerations
3. **Penetration Testing:** Third-party security assessment

## Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA Readiness ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Encryption:** At-rest encryption needed for PHI
- **Access Controls:** User authentication implemented
- **Audit Trails:** Not implemented
- **Data Minimization:** Design supports this principle

### GDPR Considerations ‚úÖ
- **Data Minimization:** Only necessary data collected
- **User Control:** Users can update their data
- **Retention:** No automatic deletion implemented

## Monitoring & Alerting Recommendations

### Security Monitoring
1. **Dependency Scanning:** Automate `npm audit` in CI/CD
2. **Secret Scanning:** Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
3. **Access Monitoring:** Log authentication failures
4. **Rate Limit Monitoring:** Track API abuse attempts

### Incident Response
1. **Security Contact:** Designate security response team
2. **Vulnerability Disclosure:** Establish responsible disclosure policy
3. **Patch Management:** Process for emergency security updates

## Conclusion

**The Inferno AI platform has been significantly hardened through this audit.** Critical authentication vulnerabilities have been resolved, and fundamental security controls are now in place. The remaining issues are primarily operational considerations for production deployment.

**Security Score:** B+ (Good)
- ‚úÖ Authentication: Secure
- ‚úÖ Dependency Management: Good  
- ‚úÖ Configuration: Good
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring: Needs Implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Readiness: Needs HTTPS/TLS

### Next Steps
1. Plan production deployment security (HTTPS, secrets management)
2. Implement monitoring and alerting
3. Consider security testing before public release
4. Document security procedures for development team
